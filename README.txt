Pro Wrestling Tournament

Introduction
- This project is a simulation of wrestler objects. Each wrestler will be matched with an opponent to fight. The last standing wrestler will be crowned champion. There are two options before starting the simulation. The first is the "Autoplay" option. This option allows you to skip to the end of the simulation and review the entire history of the fight. The second option is the manual option. The user will be able to go through the tournament fight by fight. This option is a lot more fun for the user, with a better interface.

Future Implementation
- In the future, I plan on making several additions and edits to this project. First, is the creation of wrestlers. I intended to have implemented in this release but was focused on the requirements of the project first. Next, I would also want to format it a little different. The styling could definitely use an upgrade. Also, I would like it to be more animated, such as the wrestler pictures moving.

About the Author
- All code and was written by me (Noah Vogtli). The algorithm for shuffling the array of objects was found at the credited resource in the functions document.
